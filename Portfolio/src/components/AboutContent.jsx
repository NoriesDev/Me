                    <h5 className="font-four text-rosa text-lg font-bold">Embarking on the unexpected</h5>
                    <p className="mx-2 md:mx-8">My coding journey began with an unexpected turn of events. I'd been working in the vibrant world of hospitality for over a decade, the last three as an assistant restaurant manager. It was a chapter filled with buzzing energy and the art of creating experiences.

                    <h5 className="font-four text-rosa text-lg font-bold">The transition to the digital World</h5>
                    <p className="mx-2 md:mx-8">However, during my last holiday, armed with a laptop and a vision, I dove head first into creating my very first website using WordPress; I'm a curious soul. I remember spending hours tweaking pixel by pixel, trying to get the images to line up perfectly, the text to flow harmoniously and the white space to feel just right. But oh, what a maze it was! A pixel too far to the left and chaos ensued; a font too bold and the harmony was shattered. It was a journey of trial and error, an eternal puzzle that left me wishing for a magic wand to unravel the chaos.</p>

                    <h5 className="font-four text-rosa text-lg font-bold">A shifting horizon</h5>
                    <p className="mx-2 md:mx-8">Why not delve deeper into the craft that both baffled and fascinated me? It felt like a calling to enter the world of programming. A few moons later, life took a turn; a work-related injury became a watershed moment that redirected my path. Throughout my recovery, the idea of becoming a programmer blossomed into a compelling vision for my future. The frustration of mastering WordPress, coupled with the pull of programming, paved the way for an exciting and life-changing journey into the coding universe.</p>

                    <h5 className="font-four text-rosa text-lg font-bold">Unveiling my passions</h5>
                    <p className="mx-2 md:mx-8">Beyond my coding realms, I'm an explorer at heart. Travelling, especially to South Africa (due to my roots), energises my soul. But that's not all - I'm a hobby chef, hiker and bookworm. Coffee, music, singing and various art forms, from pen and paper sketches to watercolours, textiles and graphic design, fuel my creative side.</p>

                    <h5 className="font-four text-rosa text-lg font-bold">A gateway to limitless learning</h5>
                    <p className="mx-2 md:mx-8">Coding isn't just a job - it's an opportunity for a life of endless learning and growth. In my previous career, I felt like I was running on autopilot. Coding, on the other hand, completely engages me. When I'm coding, the world melts away and I step into a realm of my own, wearing my noise-cancelling headphones, enveloped in complete silence, lost in my world and experiencing a sense of immersion like never before. Imagine diving into a full-stack web and app development bootcamp - a playground where HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express and more became my daily vocabulary. Graduating was such a milestone! Group projects, sleepless nights and an array of technologies - it shaped my skills and fuelled my desire to conquer more.</p>

                    <h5 className="font-four text-rosa text-lg font-bold">The art of problem solving</h5>
                    <p className="mx-2 md:mx-8">I've cultivated strong problem-solving skills in over a decade of working in the hospitality industry, managing teams and effectively dealing with customer needs and complaints. During the COVID-19 lockdown, I navigated roles in a test centre and a cinema, demonstrating my adaptability in dealing with evolving situations. In coding, problem solving takes on a whole new dimension. A hyper-focused state takes over, it's a journey where I delve into the lines of code, striving to solve the intricate problems they can hold. Despite the occasional frustration and sleepless nights, cracking the code brings an incomparable sense of triumph. It's that thrill, that joy of overcoming obstacles, that makes every challenge in programming worthwhile.</p>

                    <p className="mx-2 md:mx-8">In the world of ones and zeros, I've found my canvas, my sanctuary and my playground, where every line of code acts as an artist's brushstroke, painting vibrant and engaging websites. As a full-stack web developer, I've unlocked a thrilling ride through the ever-evolving universe of technology.</p>
